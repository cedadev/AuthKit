To use this example do the following:

1. Edit ``app.py`` to choose the database you wish to use.
   The default should be fine but you will need ``pysqlite`` installed.
   
2. Start the example server (this will create the database and setup the
   user information)::

        python app.py
        
3. Visit the server at http://localhost:8080/private

4. Delete the test.db file if you want to test the example again.

The usernames and passwords are set up in the app.py file.
